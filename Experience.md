# Experience

## Experience Levels and the Skill Bar

Each character has a colored experience track divided into four levels:

- Blue (0–6 XP)
- Yellow (7–18 XP)
- Orange (19–42 XP)
- Red (43+ XP)

As you collect XP, you move your tracker forward. The color zone your marker is in determines what active skills you can use.

## Unlocking Active Skills

Each survivor starts with one blue skill, which is always active from the start.
When you cross into a new color zone, you immediately choose one of the new skills listed in that zone.

For example:

- Reaching Yellow: You must activate the yellow skill shown (always "+1 Action").
- Reaching Orange: You choose one of two orange skills.
- Reaching Red: You choose one of three red skills.

From that point on, the chosen skills remain active for the rest of the mission. You don't lose earlier ones — they stack.

## Extended Experience Progression in Zombicide

Normally, the experience (XP) track on a survivor dashboard goes from 0 to 43+, with color thresholds at:

- Blue: 0–6
- Yellow: 7–18
- Orange: 19–42
- Red: 43+

When you reach 43 XP, you enter the Red zone — and that's where things start to loop once you go beyond it.

### Hitting 43 XP and Beyond

When a survivor's XP counter passes 43, you continue counting XP to track overflow.

Once you've earned enough XP to "fill" the bar again, the progression effectively resets to Blue — you've wrapped around the bar.

### Second Cycle Through the XP Bar

When your XP wraps around and you level up again, the survivor doesn't start over as a new character — instead, they pick up the remaining skills that weren't selected before.

Here's how it works:

#### First XP Cycle

- Blue skill: Always active.
- Yellow skill: Gained automatically.
- Orange: Choose 1 of 2.
- Red: Choose 1 of 3.

#### Second XP Cycle (after hitting 43 XP again)

- Blue and Yellow stay the same — those never change.
- At Orange: You now gain the remaining Orange skill you didn't pick the first time.
- At Red: You pick one of the two remaining Red skills.

At this point, your survivor has:

- 1 Blue skill
- 1 Yellow skill
- Both Orange skills
- 2 of 3 Red skills

### Third Cycle (Final Level-Up)

Once you fill the XP track a third time (after hitting 43 XP yet again), you enter your final experience cycle.

- At Orange: You already have both skills, so nothing new happens here.
- At Red: You gain your last remaining Red skill — completing your skill set.

At this point, your survivor has unlocked every skill printed on their dashboard and is considered at maximum experience or "fully evolved."

### Why This Exists

This "looping" XP system appears in some campaigns and extended missions (like Washington Z.C., Fort Hendrix, and other long-form play modes) where missions can last several sessions or allow huge kill counts.
It rewards continuous play and gives long-term survivors new milestones to work toward beyond the initial Red skill.

It also keeps players motivated to keep earning XP instead of feeling capped.

### 🔥 Example: Doug's Full Experience Progression

| XP Cycle | Color Level | Skill(s) Gained |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1st | Blue | Starts with 1 Blue skill |
| 1st | Yellow | +1 Action |
| 1st | Orange | Picks "+1 Die: Ranged" |
| 1st | Red | Picks "Reaper: Ranged" |
| 2nd | Orange | Gains remaining Orange skill ("+1 Free Ranged Action") |
| 2nd | Red | Picks 2nd Red skill ("+1 to Dice Roll: Ranged") |
| 3rd | Red | Gains last remaining Red skill ("Tough") — now fully maxed out |

At this point, Doug has:
- 1 Blue skill (starting)
- 1 Yellow skill
- 2 Orange skills
- 3 Red skills

Doug is now considered **fully leveled** or **max experience**. Further XP gains don't grant new abilities, but should still be tracked for fun or campaign milestones.
